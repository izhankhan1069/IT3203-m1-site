    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>Hey! My name is Izhan Mohammed, and this is my first official web development project for IT 3203. This website is my way of showing what I’ve learned about HTML and CSS so far. The goal is simple — understand how these two languages come together to create functional and attractive web pages.</p>
    <p>I based my project around the W3.CSS Parallax template because I thought it looked clean, professional, and realistic for a beginner like me. Throughout this project, I’ll be walking through what I learned about the structure, styling, and small design tricks that make modern websites look the way they do.</p>
    <p>Use the menu above to check out each part of my project.</p>
