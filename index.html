  <h2>Welcome to My HTML and CSS Project</h2>
  <p>This website is part of my IT 3203 course and is built using a parallax template from W3Schools. My major objective was to explain how the template makes use of HTML and CSS to get a clean and modern style without requiring excessive JavaScript or other libraries.</p>

  <p>On these pages, I explain and reveal how the structure of the HTML supports the design, how the CSS controls things like spacing and fonts, and how the site can still stay readable on different screen sizes. I also built a small quiz so oncoming viewers can check what they remember after reading.</p>

  <h3>What You Will Find Here</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>An overview of the template and layout decisions</li>
    <li>A closer look at the parallax sections and design choices</li>
    <li>Discussion of semantics, structure, and basic performance ideas</li>
    <li>Key concepts and resources related to HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>A short self check quiz based on this content</li>
  </ul>
