    <h2>Welcome to My HTML and CSS Project</h2>

    <p>This website is part of my IT 3203 course and is built using a parallax template from W3Schools. My major objective was to explain how the template makes use of HTML and CSS to get a clean and modern style without requiring excessive JavaScript or other libraries.</p>

    <p>On these pages, I explain and reveal how the structure of the HTML supports the design, how the CSS controls things like spacing and fonts, and how the site can still stay readable on different screen sizes. I also built a small quiz so oncoming viewers can check what they remember after reading.</p>
