    <h2>How I Got Started</h2>
    <p>When I first saw the Parallax template on W3Schools, I liked how simple but advanced it looked. I realized that most modern websites are just organized layouts with creative use of spacing, colors, and animations.</p>

    <p>My approach was to look at the HTML source code and identify how each section was built. I used the browser’s developer tools to check which CSS rules applied to different parts of the page.</p>

    <p>One thing that surprised me was how much you can do with just a few lines of CSS. Even simple effects make a website feel more interactive and professional.</p>
