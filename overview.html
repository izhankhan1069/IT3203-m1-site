    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <p>For this project, I chose to study the parallax template from W3Schools because it looks simple at first but has a lot going on under the surface. The template uses a mix of basic HTML tags, background images, and reusable CSS classes to keep everything organized. It showed me that a clean layout is more about structure and spacing than just fancy effects.</p>

    <p>My approach was to look at the source code, section by section, and figure out how each part of the page was built. I paid attention to the way the content was grouped, how classes were reused, and how text and images were aligned. After that, I started building my own pages using a similar idea, but with simpler code that still felt clear and easy to follow.</p>

    <p>Most of what I learned came from seeing how small CSS choices can change the feel of the whole page. Even things like padding, font size, and background color can make a big difference. This project helped me understand that HTML provides the skeleton, while CSS gives the page its personality.</p>
