    <h2>How I Got Started</h2>
    <p>When I first saw the Parallax template on W3Schools, I liked how simple but advanced it looked. It used clean HTML and CSS without relying on any extra libraries or JavaScript. I realized that most modern websites are just organized layouts with creative use of spacing, colors, and animations. That’s what I wanted to understand.</p>
    <p>My approach was to look at the HTML source code and identify how each section was built. I used the browser’s developer tools to check which CSS rules applied to different parts of the page. From there, I recreated my own simplified version while keeping the layout responsive and visually balanced.</p>
    <p>One thing that surprised me was how much you can do with just a few lines of CSS. You don’t need to overcomplicate things to make a site look professional, you just need structure, color balance, and attention to detail.</p>
