    <h2>Parallax Layout and Design</h2>

    <p>The original W3Schools template uses large background images to create a parallax effect, where the image feels fixed while the content scrolls over it. Even though my site does not fully copy that effect, the idea of stacking clear sections is still there. Each section has its own purpose and breathing room, which keeps the page from feeling cramped.</p>

    <p>In my own version, I focused more on a simple layout that would still make sense on different screen sizes. Instead of relying only on big images, I tried to use headings, paragraphs, and spacing to separate ideas. This made the site easier to read and also easier to maintain, since I did not have to manage a lot of extra image code.</p>

    <p>One thing that stood out to me while looking at the template is how reusable classes are used in multiple sections. The same padding or text alignment class can appear in different places, which keeps the CSS file shorter and more organized. That is something I tried to copy in a basic way in my own style sheet.</p>
