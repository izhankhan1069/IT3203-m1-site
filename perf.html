  <h2>Code Structure and Performance</h2>
  <p>While I did not run technical performance tests, I still paid attention to how the structure of the HTML and CSS can affect how a page loads and behaves. A simple layout with fewer files is usually easier for the browser to handle. That is one of the reasons I kept everything in a single CSS file and used a separate JavaScript file only for the quiz.</p>

  <p>Keeping the HTML clean also matters significantly. Using proper tags, not repeating the same code too much, and grouping related content inside clear sections all help other people read the code. It would also make it easier to update or expand the site later without breaking everything.</p>

  <p>On the visual side, I tried to avoid huge images and made sure that images and tables can adjust to the screen width. This not only helps on mobile, but can also reduce awkward scrolling and slow loading. Overall, my goal was not to chase perfect performance, but to build something that feels light, simple, and easy to use.</p>
